# bus-tracker
an application that shows when busses are expected to arrive at your location

## Concept
This application makes it easier to quickly check when your bus will depart. Instead of asking a lot of details about your journey like 9292ov.nl does, you can just type in the name of the bus stop and instantly see what busses will arrive shortly. If possible it will also show a map with the precise gps locations of those busses.
